## Motivation

Vertical slider/carousel is cool!
You can implement this easily with JavaScript library such as [Splide](https://splidejs.com/), or [scroll-snap-type CSS property](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/scroll-snap-type).

However, most users expect to be able to scroll the slider whether the cursor is placed inside or outside the element.

This article shows how to implement it.

## Demo

⚠️ Please scroll inside the iframe.

<iframe
  src="/scrap/demo/vertical-slider"
  width="100%"
  height="600px"
  frameborder="0"
  style="border: 3px solid #aaa;"
/>

## How it works

### Capture wheel events (includes the children element's events)

You can capture wheel events in the document, even if the cursor is on the children element.

```js
document.addEventListener(
  "wheel",
  (e) => {
    console.log(`Scroll size (Y): ${e.deltaY}`);
  },
  {
    passive: false,
    capture: true,
  },
);
```
