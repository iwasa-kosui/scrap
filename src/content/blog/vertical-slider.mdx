## Motivation

Vertical slider/carousel is cool!
You can implement this easily with JavaScript library such as [Splide](https://splidejs.com/), or [scroll-snap-type CSS property](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/scroll-snap-type).

However, most users expect to be able to scroll the slider whether the cursor is placed inside or outside the element.

This article shows how to implement it.
